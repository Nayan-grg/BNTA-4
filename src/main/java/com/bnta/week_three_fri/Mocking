//During testing, you don't pass anything to a constructor so no dependencies
//DAO stores data to a file -- file database
//Mocking is required to run test otherwise ir would be really slow if there are a lot of dependencies and if the file is too big
If the file is large, testing would slow down
In cases where you need to test all the classes that are dependent on each other, test can become slow so mocking is needed

//Integration testing - testing all the classes dependent on each other so if there are dependencies,
//Unit testing - is when you test in isolation

Mocking is when you create a dummy and not actually use the real object.
Mocking is a part of unit testing, we didn't learn about integration testing
