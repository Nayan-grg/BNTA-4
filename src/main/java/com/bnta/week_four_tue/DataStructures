a way storing a collection of data.
Map can have a key and value
List similar to array
data structures -> we can perform different functions on them

What is data structure:
Is a way of organising data so that it can be used effectively.
Data can be stored using various methods and each method has its own set of functions that it can be performed on it

Always use List:
List are arrays but they grow in size
theres no gap in between so you dont have to loop through the array to add an element
List is a collectionn so there are bunch of methods associated with it. ArrayList,__,__ are implementation.

bad practice because it is inconvineint to have different data types in one list

What is a cast?
Person person = (Person)e

<Integer> is different from int. <Integer> is an object.

Stack:
you can't access the bottom bit, can only access the top bit
