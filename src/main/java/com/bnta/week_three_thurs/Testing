//Testing is important to ensure it works
//JUnit allows us to do testing
//AssertJ allows us to perform assertion
//Maven allows us to bring in other dependency that other people bring in.
//Only need to do testing on class that performs business logic
//unit --> usually a method that you can test in isolation
//You can't test private method because you can't access from other class--> you can't test private method
//Run coverage on intellij --> But can't achieve 100% test coverage because you can't test constructors, static block
