Interface:
An interface is a class that contains method with no body, aka abstract methods.

Why is interface useful:
An interface have multiple implementation. Implementation behave a bit different.

Polymorphism:
It means that something has many forms.
Example:
"+" This works differently in integers and strings -> In strings, it is concatenating
but in integer, it is adding the values together
